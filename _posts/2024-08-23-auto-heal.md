This blog post explains the important information on the troubleshooting tool, Auto-heal. How to use it, how to configure it and the different options that we have. 


## What is Auto-Heal in Azure?

Auto-heal is a feature designed to monitor the health of your web application and automatically take corrective actions if issues are detected. It helps ensure that your application remains available and responsive to users even in the face of unexpected errors or performance degradation.

**Key features of auto-heal**

-   **Monitoring:** Auto-heal continuously monitors various aspects of your application, such as response time, memory usage, and CPU utilization.
-   **Alerts:** When certain thresholds are exceeded or specific issues are detected, auto-heal triggers alerts to notify administrators or developers.
-   **Actions:** Depending on the severity of the issue, auto-heal can take different actions to address the problem. These actions may include recycling the application process, which effectively restarts the application, or even swapping the deployment slot to a previous version that is known to be stable.
-   **Customization:** Azure App Services allows you to customize the auto-heal settings based on your application's specific requirements. You can define thresholds, specify the actions to be taken, and configure alert notifications according to your preferences.


## Where can I configure the Auto-Heal tool? 

You can configure the auto-heal feature through the Azure portal. Here's how you can access and configure it:

    1. Navigate to your App Service: Log in to the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate to the specific Azure App Service for which you want to configure auto-heal.
    2. Once you're on the overview page of your App Service, look for the **Diagnose and Solve Problems** option in the left-hand menu. Click on it and then select the **Diagnostic Tools** tab.

    4. Click the **Auto-Heal** tab under the Proactive Tools section. 
    Configure auto-heal rules: Within the Auto-Heal section, you should see 3 tabs, one being the "Custom Auto-Heal Rules", secondly "Proactive Auto-Heal" and third is "History". You can configure and enable the Auto-Heal rules here.


## Custom Auto-Heal

**1. Define the Conditions:**
    The first thing we should do is determine the condition in which want the mitigation action to occur. 
    
    The conditions supported on Auto heal:
    o	**Request Duration:** examines slow requests.
    o	**Memory Limit:** examines process memory in private bytes.
    o	**Request Count:** examines number of requests.
    o	**Status Codes:** examines number of requests and their HTTP status code
    
    **Request Duration example**

    I've set the condition to trigger the action if there are 100 requests taking 20 seconds or more within the last 300 seconds. My app will be automatically recycled.

**1. Configure Actions:**
    Select the option that best matches the auto heal mitigation action that you need to perform under the mitigation rule conditions that is configured from the above step.

    Actions supported by Auto-Heal:
    o	**Recycle Process.**
    o	**Log an Event.**
    o	**Custom Action:**
        •	Memory dump
        •	Java memory dump
        •	Java thread dump
        •	CLR profiler
        •	CLR profiler with thread stacks
        •	Run any executable

    **Collect Kill and Analyze**
    When this option is selected, when the condition is met and the action is triggered, the data is collected and the process will be terminated.

**3. Override When Action Executes (Startup Time):**
    When an app has a long startup time, depending on the mitigation rule conditions that are set, the mitigation action may be initiated during app startup, which is not the intended use case. To avoid mitigation actions to kick in immediately after app starts, it is advisable to set the startup time to at least 600 seconds (10 minutes). This will ensure that mitigation actions don't kick in during app's cold start.

**4. Review and Save your settings:**
    Saving mitigation settings will restart the app and this can cause logged-in user information, sessions, and in-memory cache to be cleared. Hence, it is advised to make these changes during non-business hours. 
    
    Review the configuration that you've set and then click **Save**.

## Proactive Auto-Heal
 
Proactive Auto-Heal is an extension to the auto healing feature of Azure App Service. It will only take corrective actions for the sites that we have deemed to be in a bad state for which the best way to recover is to simply restart them. Proactive Auto-Heal monitors for high memory and slow response situations and recycles the app when one of these conditions is met. By default, proactive auto-heal will be enabled. 


## History of Auto-Heal Triggers
 
The history tab will show you the times that Auto-Heal was triggered for your apps.
